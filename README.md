Bird language was spoken back when I was a kid. I can say that it is quite tongue-twisting, but if you have the word in your mind and break it into syllables, you can speak this language very easily. You need a lot of exercise.

The basics are: 

After the vowels A E I O U put the following:

 A = pa
 E = pe
 I = pi
O = po
U = pu

  the consonants do not change usually. 

  Enjoy!
